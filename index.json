However, managing a global user base and ensuring seamless performance isn’t easy, especially when searches involve massive amounts of data spread across different regions.\nTo overcome the challenge, Tinder adopted Geosharding: a method of dividing user data into geographically bound \u0026ldquo;shards.\u0026rdquo;\nThis approach enabled the recommendation engine to focus searches only on relevant data, dramatically improving performance and scalability. The system now handles 20 times more computations than before while maintaining low latency and delivering matches faster than ever.\nIn this post, we’ll explore how Geosharding works, the architecture behind it, and the techniques Tinder uses to ensure data consistency.\n","permalink":"https://weeklyarxiv.github.io/posts/2024/12/how-tinder-recommends-to-75-million/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eDisclaimer: The details in this post have been derived from the Tinder Technical Blog.
